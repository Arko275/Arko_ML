# Daily Demand Forecasting for Restaurant Orders using Linear Regression

This project builds a predictive model to forecast daily restaurant orders, aimed at improving inventory management and resource allocation through more accurate demand prediction. Using linear regression, this model analyzes historical data to identify demand trends and provide actionable insights for restaurant operations.

## Project Overview

Demand forecasting is essential for restaurants to optimize inventory levels, minimize waste, and ensure resource availability. This project leverages machine learning, specifically linear regression, to create a forecasting model that predicts the daily demand for restaurant orders. The result is a data-driven approach to streamline restaurant operations and enhance decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleanses and prepares historical data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key features that impact daily order trends.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Uses linear regression to predict future daily orders based on historical patterns.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy to ensure reliable predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arko275/daily-demand-forecasting.git
    cd daily-demand-forecasting
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
   import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
    ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset: Ensure that historical order data is available in the specified format (e.g., `csv`).
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Daily_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the notebook steps to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate forecasts.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the historical data files used for forecasting.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with the full data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation processes.
- **models/**: Trained model files (optional).
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Results

- **Model Performance**: Evaluation metrics for accuracy.
- **Forecasts**: Predicted daily orders for future dates.
  
This model provides insights into order trends and helps improve operational efficiency for restaurants.

## Future Work

- Experiment with additional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Integrate external factors (e.g., weather, holidays) to enhance forecasting accuracy.
- Deploy as a web service for real-time demand forecasting.
